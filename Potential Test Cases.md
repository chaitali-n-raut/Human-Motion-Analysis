# Potential Test Cases 

# Video Input Test Cases
1. Valid video file: Test with a valid MP4 video file.
2. Invalid video file: Test with an invalid or corrupted video file.
3. Different video formats: Test with different video formats (e.g., AVI, MOV).

# Pose Estimation Test Cases
1. Single person in frame: Test with a video of a single person in the frame.
2. Multiple people in frame: Test with a video of multiple people in the frame.
3. Partial occlusion: Test with a video where the person is partially occluded.

# Motion Analysis Test Cases
1. Walking motion: Test with a video of a person walking.
2. Running motion: Test with a video of a person running.
3. Stationary motion: Test with a video of a person standing still.

# Calculation Test Cases
1. Distance calculation: Test the accuracy of distance calculations.
2. Speed calculation: Test the accuracy of speed calculations.
3. Angle calculation: Test the accuracy of angle calculations (e.g., elbow angle).

# Edge Case Test Cases
1. Low lighting conditions: Test with a video recorded in low lighting conditions.
2. High motion blur: Test with a video with high motion blur.
3. Complex background: Test with a video with a complex background.

# Output Test Cases
1. Correct output display: Test that the output (e.g., speed, distance, angle) is displayed correctly.
2. Output accuracy: Test the accuracy of the output values.

By testing these cases, you can ensure that your Human Motion Analysis project is robust and accurate.
