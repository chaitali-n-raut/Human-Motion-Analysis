# Human-Motion-Analysis
The Human Motion Analysis Using Vector Calculations [Python]

#Step-by-step description of the code:

Step-by-Step Process
1. Importing Libraries: Imported necessary libraries such as MediaPipe, OpenCV, NumPy, and Tkinter.

2. Defining Utility Functions: Defined functions to calculate distances and angles between body points.

3. MediaPipe Setup: Set up MediaPipe's pose estimation solution.

4. Video File Selection: Selected a video file using Tkinter's file dialog.

5. Opening Video Capture: Opened the selected video file using OpenCV.

6. Tracking Movement: Tracked human movement in the video and calculated vectors (distances and angles) between body points.

7. Calculating Vectors: Calculated distances and angles between body points using NumPy.

8. Displaying Results: Successfully tracked human motion and calculated vectors.
